## Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive analysis and modeling of daily visitors to four different restaurants, utilizing various statistical and machine-learning techniques. The dataset, `RestaurantVisitors.csv`, tracks visitor counts and holiday indicators over time.

### Dataset Description



## Objectives

The primary goal of this project is to predict daily restaurant visitors using various modeling techniques, comparing their performance based on the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) as the primary metric.
